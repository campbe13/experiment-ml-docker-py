# experiment-ml-docker-py
experimenting with ML (scikit etc) &amp; python &amp; docker for python

* temperature - classification - uses a simple temperature range example (ml & plain old py (popy))
* algebraeic - regression - uses a simple algebraeic function (ml & popy)
* Docker-py - set up to use Docker to run apps
## Usage Notes
Note I do not use python environments because I use mostly containers so apps are encapsulated anyway & envs are moot.
### for python
* Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (or other text editor)
* Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) TL;DR `pip install -U scikit-learn`  
    Note On win pro, using a vscode terminal needed `-m`   in `py  -m pip install -U scikit-learn `
* You may also want [pandas](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-pandas-in-python/) or TL;DR `pip install pandas`
### for docker (optional, I was playing with this for the sci & engr course in 2022)
* Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
